## Overview

**Muscle Valley Gym**

Muscle Valley Gym was created from the COVID-19 pandemic after the owners notice a change to the new normal where people needed somewhere safe and engaging to interact with others whilst being able to improve both physical and mental health. 

Having a website that will allow potential customers a glimpse into the unique culture and the services the gym provides will be in most cases the first impression of the company.

## Skeleton

### Wireframes

>- [Home Page Wireframe](./assets/wireframes/home-page.pdf)
>- [About-Us Page Wireframe](./assets/wireframes/about-us-page.pdf)
>- [Join-Us Page Wireframe](./assets/wireframes/join-now-page.pdf)

Changes were made during development from the wireframes to improve the flow and user engagement when using the site. 

## Surface

>### Typography
> When deciding which font to use I chose `Calibri`, as most microsoft 365 applications will use this as a default which would be the one most people will be familiar with and will find the site easier to engage with.

>### Images
> All the images used in the project were taken from Unsplash and they were selected basis on relevance to the culture that was to be portrayed on the site. 

>### Video
> The video used in the project was taken from YouTube, licencing for this is free and credit is further down on the readme.

>### Logo
>- For the logo, this was created using Font Awesome icons to be uniquely identifiable to the gym where the dumbbell represents muscle and the two mountain icons close together represent a valley.
>- Both combined together is `Muscle Valley`. 

>### Colour Scheme
>When choosing the colour scheme it was based on the comptibility with the hero image of the index page, due to the dark nature of the image a darker theme was chosen to compliment this.
>
>After the background colour was picked, the rest of the colours were chosen based on if the stood out clearly to the user and the infomation was able to be read without issue. 
>
> The main colours used are:
>- Background = rbga(22, 18, 15, 0.996)
>- Font = #fafafa
>
>Here are all of the colours that were used on the site:- ![Site Colour Palette](./assets/images/image-gradient-theme.jpg)

## Features

### Existing Features

>#### Responsive Layout and design
>- The site was built with responsiveness in mind, starting from Moto G4 view and developing the site out from this screen size first as a vast amount of users main access point to the internet will be from a mobile device.

>- The border will glow blue every 3 seconds and when the mouse is hovering over it the animation will pause where the text will turn red to highlight. 
>- This feature will entice the user to click on the link.

>- All the feilds on the modal are required to be filled in otherwise the form won't be able to be submitted. 
>- To close the modal either the 'X' at the top right of the modal or the 'Close' button at the bottom right will need to be clicked.
>- When hovering over the 'Submit' the button will turn to a darker blue, to encourage the user to click it.
>- When the 'Submit' button is clicked the form details will be submitted to the selected location.


### Future Feature Considerations

Due to current knowledge with Web Development, the below are enhancements that would improve user experience and allow more self-service when it comes to the membership of the gym.

>#### Membership Sign Up
> An area where potential members are able to sign up, select and create a direct debit for membership on the website would enhance user experience when using the website. 

>#### Members Area
> An area where where exisiting members are able to login and access members only content, change the type of membership, update bank details, sign up to classes and much more for improved user experience/autonomy for the business.
